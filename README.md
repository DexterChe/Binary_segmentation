# Binarization Approaches in Image Processing

This repository provides a detailed exploration of various binarization techniques, crucial for converting grayscale images into binary form for applications such as segmentation, object recognition, and feature extraction.

## Overview

The notebook `Binarization.ipynb` demonstrates multiple binarization approaches to enhance image processing tasks. These methods include:

- **Otsuâ€™s Thresholding**: An automatic, global thresholding method that minimizes intra-class variance.
- **Adaptive Thresholding**: A local approach that adjusts thresholding dynamically across different image regions.
- **Custom Thresholding Techniques**: User-defined thresholds for specific use cases where traditional methods fall short.

## Features

- **Data Preparation**: Loading and preprocessing data for optimal binarization results.
- **Comparison of Techniques**: Visual and quantitative comparison of binarization methods, highlighting differences in accuracy, contrast retention, and computational efficiency.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assessing each method's performance based on predefined metrics to determine the best approach for different types of data.

## Usage

Clone this repository and open `Binarization.ipynb` to explore the analysis. The notebook is self-contained, and each section provides comments and explanations for easier understanding. The techniques demonstrated can be adapted to various image processing pipelines in fields like defect analysis, document scanning, and biomedical imaging.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, and others as specified in the notebook.
